## Cryptosense
With the Cryptosense Discovery Provider you can easily start searching for certificates not only in network, but also in applications, filesystems, containers, or hardware security modules!

CZERTAINLY and Cryptosense provides together a comprehensive solution to manage not only certificates, but also cryptographic keys and protect yourself from related vulnerabilities.

Cryptosense Discovery Provider can discover certificates from:
- Network
- Applications
- File System
- Containers
- HSM

To know more about Cryptosense, refer to [Cryptosense](https://cryptosense.com).

The connector provides options to search for certificates in various projects and reports generated by the Cryptosens Analyzer.

## Short Process Description

Connector discovers the certificates from Cryptosense projects and reports. It connects to the Cryptosense using the URL authorized by API Key. Once the credentials and other required parameters are configured, the connector uses GraphQL API to get the information about discovered certificates.

Once the certificates are discovered they are parsed and stored within the certificate inventory managed by the Core.
