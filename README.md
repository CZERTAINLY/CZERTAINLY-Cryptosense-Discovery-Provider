## Cryptosense

With the `Cryptosense` `Discovery Provider` you can easily start searching for certificates not only in network, but also in applications, filesystems, containers, or hardware security modules!

CZERTAINLY and `Cryptosense` provides together a comprehensive solution to manage not only certificates, but also cryptographic keys and protect yourself from related vulnerabilities.

`Cryptosense` `Discovery Provider` can discover certificates from:
- Network
- Applications
- File System
- Containers
- HSM

To know more about Cryptosense, refer to [Cryptosense](https://cryptosense.com).

The `Connector` provides options to search for certificates in various projects and reports generated by the Cryptosens Analyzer.

## Short Process Description

`Connector` discovers certificates from Cryptosense projects and reports. It connects to the Cryptosense using the URL authorized by API Key. Once the `Credentials` and other required parameters are configured, the `Connector` uses GraphQL API to get the information about discovered certificates.

Once certificates are discovered they are parsed and stored within the certificate inventory managed by the `Core`.

To know more about `Core`, refer to [CZERTAINLY Core](https://github.com/3KeyCompany/CZERTAINLY-Core).

## Interfaces

`Cryptosense` `Discovery Provider` implements the `Discovery Provider` Interface from the CZERTAINLY Interfaces. To learn more about the interfaces and end points, refer to the [CZERTAINLY Interfaces](https://github.com/3KeyCompany/CZERTAINLY-Interfaces).
